Blazor Localization Sample

This sample code demonstrates Blazor localization with XLocalizer based on XML resource files.

Before running the project make sure that you have added RapidAPI key to user secrets as described here:


{
  "XLocalizer.Translate": {
    "RapidApiKey": "xxx-rapid-api-key-xxx",
  }
}

Also you need to subscribe to MyMemory tranlsation and/or other registered translation services (free plan also works)

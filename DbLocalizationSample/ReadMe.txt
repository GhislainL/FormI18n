DB Localization Sample

This sample code demonstrates localization with XLocalizer based on DB.

Before running the project make sure that you have added necessary API keys to user secrets as described here:

{
  "XLocalizer.Translate": {
    "RapidApiKey": "xxx-rapid-api-key-xxx",
  }
}

Also you need to subscribe to MyMemory tranlsation and/or other registered translation services (free plan also works)
